# speech-emotion-recognition
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust SER system capable of accurately identifying and classifying emotions conveyed through speech. By harnessing the capabilities of LSTM models, we aim to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in speech signals, enabling our system to recognize subtle nuances in emotional expressions.
